Hamiltonian Monte Carlo image modeling kit


This program optimizes a linear generative model of images. The model is
directed, and is defined as follows:

x = \Phi a + n

where x is an image, and the image likelihood given the latent variables is:

p(x|a) = N(0, \sigma I) \, .

Two priors are included, both i.i.d. A Gaussian prior:

p(a) = N(0, I)

and a Laplacian prior:

p(a) = 1/2 exp(-||a||_1) \, .

The parameters \Phi and \sigma are learned using expectation maximization.
The posterior over the latent variables p(a|x) is represented using an HMC
algorithm. We introduce momentum variables, v, one per latent 'a' variable

p(v) = N(0, I)
